## 🛠️ Technical Details

- Built with vanilla JavaScript
- Uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Implements object-oriented particle system
- Custom physics-based motion algorithms
- Dynamic color palette management

## 🎨 Available Effects

### Color Smoke
Creates smooth, colorful smoke-like patterns that follow mouse movement with natural diffusion.

### Galaxy Spiral
Generates spiral formations of particles that create galaxy-like swirling patterns.

### Neon Trails
Produces glowing trails of particles with persistence and fade effects.

### Fireflies
Creates pulsating particles that float and glow with organic movement patterns.

## 🔧 Customization

You can customize various aspects of the effects by modifying the following parameters in the code:

- Color palettes in the `palettes` object
- Particle behaviors in the `Particle` class
- Animation speeds and particle counts
- Blur and fade effects
